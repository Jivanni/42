## Overview

Repository containing my work done during the 2020 October Piscine at 42 Roma Luiss.
The October 2020 Piscine were the first piscine ever for the Italian 42 branch.
At 42 Rome Luiss, there are not traditional classes, and students are given several projects 
to work on in accordance with the principles of videogames. 
Students are encouraged to challenge your mindset and ideas, ask questions, rethink the way you think about business with your peers.
At the C Piscine, students develop skills such as:

* C Programming
* Shell Scripting
* Teamwork
