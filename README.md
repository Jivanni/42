## Overview

Repository containing my work done during the 2020 October Piscine at 42 Roma, that follows a logical sequence of
17 long-lasting skills that speak to businesses. These skills also have the same
fundamental element: personal adaptability, learning, coping and solving new
challenges that they will inevitably face regularly. Even if it has a few
obligatory paths, 42â€™s program is individually tailored throughout their
educational experience. Many classical themes are addressed in order to develop
the skills they contain, like:

* Computer Science / Programming
* Innovation
* Infrastructures
* Personal Development and Expression
* Entrepreneurship
